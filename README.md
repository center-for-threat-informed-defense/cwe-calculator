# CWE with Environmental CVSS Calculator

The CWE with Environmental CVSS Calculator computes an average CVSS score for the CVEs
associated with a given CWE, which serves as an estimate of its severity. The
calculation uses data from the [National Vulnerability Database
(NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/). You can customize the calculator in several ways,
including timeboxing, CWE normalization, and supplying CVSS environmental modifiers.

## Getting Involved

There are several ways that you can get involved with this project and help
advance threat-informed defense:

- **Run the command line tool.** Try using the command line tool to score CWEs using
  your own CVSS environmental modifiers.
- **Learn about the web service.** You can run the web service on-prem in support of
  CI/CD platforms.
